# A base project to start a node.js server

Features:
* Dockerfile to package and run the server
* Onion architecture for ease of testing
* Sample tests for models and services (mocha)
* Yarn workspaces
* Typescript
* Linting

## How to use

Basic commands can be found under root package.json

## TODOs:

- [ ] Add tests for library
- [ ] Persistence layers should throw specific errors for common use cases (duplicate, constraint, etc)
- [ ] Add linting to build process (fail quicker)
- [ ] Generalize SQL persistence
